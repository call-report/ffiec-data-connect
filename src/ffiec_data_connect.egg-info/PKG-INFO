# FFIEC Data Connector

- The FFIEC Webservice Python Connector library (`ffiec_data_connect`) downloads data from the FFIEC (Federal Financial Institution Examination Council) via the FFIEC's "webservice" interface. 

- The library interfaces with the SOAP-based API published by FFIEC, normalizing dates and data, conducting transformations to permit immediate analysis of acquired data within a Python data science or scripted environment. (Software will update to new REST API in 4Q 2025)

- This library is provided for public use, subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0, by Civic Forge Solutions LLC

### Disclaimer

-  __Please review the license and disclaimer before using this package.__

### Overview

The FFIEC Webservice Python Connector (`ffiec_data_connect`) was created to facilitate the use of the SOAP-based FFIEC Webservice.

Although limited documentation is provided for the Webservice by the FFIEC, practical use of the Webservice via Python requires a considerable amount of boilerplate code - and knowledge of esoteric terms and concepts inherent to bank regulatory data.

With these challenges in mind, this package provides a Python wrapper for the FFIEC Webservice, simplifying the process of interacting with the Webservice, and allow the rapid development of Python applications that require use of the data hosted on the Webservice.

Data returned from the Webservice may be returned as a native Python data structure (`list`) or Pandas DataFrames or Series.

## Installation

``pip install ffiec-data-connect``

## Quickstart

1. To run this Quick Start, you must have an account on the FFIEC Webservice at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/PWS/CreateAccount.aspx?PWS=true
2. After you create an account, verify your password, and complete the sign-in process, log into the public web interface here: https://cdr.ffiec.gov/Public/PWS/Login.aspx
3. When you login, go to the "Account Details" tab. On this screen, look for the _Security Token_. This token is the password that you will use for the login credentials for ffiec-data-connect, __not the password__.

## Backward Compatibility and Error Handling

Starting with version 0.3.0, `ffiec-data-connect` includes enhanced error handling with specific exception types for better debugging and error context. **By default, legacy mode is enabled** to maintain backward compatibility with existing code that expects `ValueError` exceptions.

### ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

Legacy error mode is **enabled by default** but is deprecated and will be disabled in version 1.0.0. We recommend migrating to the new specific exception types for better error handling.

### Migrating to New Error Handling (Recommended)

To use the new, more descriptive exception types:

1. **Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   export FFIEC_USE_LEGACY_ERRORS=false
   python your_script.py
   ```

2. **Programmatically in your code**:
   ```python
   import ffiec_data_connect
   
   # Disable legacy mode to use new exception types
   ffiec_data_connect.disable_legacy_mode()
   
   # Now catch specific exceptions:
   from ffiec_data_connect import CredentialError, ValidationError
   
   try:
       # Your code here
   except CredentialError as e:
       print(f"Credential issue: {e}")
   except ValidationError as e:
       print(f"Validation issue: {e}")
   ```

### Maintaining Legacy Behavior

If you need to maintain the current behavior (which is default), you don't need to change anything. The library will continue to raise `ValueError` exceptions for all errors, with a deprecation warning shown once per session.

To suppress the deprecation warning while keeping legacy behavior:
```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning, module="ffiec_data_connect")
```

## Troubleshooting and Helpful Info

- General issues with certificates and authentication: Multiple users have reported issues running the library on Windows-based python installations. The issues arise from libraries that have dependencies on Windows platform-specific SSL authentication libraries. Unfortunately, there are no universal fixes to these issues, as each Windows-based installation can be unique. If you are unable to operate the library in Windows, I advise utilizing a service such as Google Colab or finding a Linux-based or Mac-based machine instead.

- Seeing the `ValueError: Invalid Format String` error? Make sure you are running version >= 0.2.7. If running earlier versions in Windows, an incompatibility with the `strptime` library prevents parsing of valid date strings. A workaround is present in more recent versions of the library. To install the latest version, you may type `pip install ffiec-data-connect==0.2.7` at the commend line.

- The FFIEC Webservice throttles requests. As per the Webservice:

```
Currently, the PWS will allow a limited number of downloads (approximately 2500 per hour). 

If the download limit has been reached within one hour, the user will have to wait until the next hour to continue with the next download.
```

A back-off function is recommended if your anticipated downloads would be greater than this limit.


## Sample Code

Sample code to login and collect reporting periods:

```
        from ffiec_data_connect import methods, credentials, ffiec_connection
        
        creds = credentials.WebserviceCredentials(username="USER_NAME_GOES_HERE", password="SECURITY_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")

        conn = ffiec_connection.FFIECConnection()

        reporting_periods = methods.collect_reporting_periods(
            session=conn,
            creds=creds,
            output_type="list",
            date_output_format="string_original"
        )
```
