# FFIEC Data Connector

The FFIEC Webservice Python Connector (`ffiec_data_connect`) was created to facilitate the use of the SOAP-based FFIEC Webservice.

### Overview

The FFIEC Webservice Python Connector (`ffiec_data_connect`) was created to facilitate the use of the SOAP-based FFIEC Webservice.

Although limited documentation is provided for the Webservice by the FFIEC, practical use of the Webservice via Python requires a considerable amount of boilerplate code - and knowledge of esoteric terms and concepts inherent to bank regulatory data.

With these challenges in mind, this package provides a Python wrapper for the FFIEC Webservice, simplifying the process of interacting with the Webservice, and allow the rapid development of Python applications that require use of the data hosted on the Webservice.

Data returned from the Webservice may be returned as a native Python data structure (`list`) or Pandas DataFrames or Series.

## Installation

``pip install ffiec-data-connect``

## Quickstart

__To run this Quick Start, you must have an account on the FFIEC Webservice at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/PWS/CreateAccount.aspx?PWS=true__

```
        from ffiec_data_connect import methods, credentials, ffiec_connection
        
        creds = credentials.WebserviceCredentials(username="user1234", password="password1234")

        conn = ffiec_connection.FFIECConnection()

        reporting_periods = methods.collect_reporting_periods(
            session=conn,
            creds=creds,
            output_type="list",
            date_output_format="string_original"
        )
```
