## Risk Mitigation

### Breaking Changes
- Immutable credentials may break existing code

### Performance Impact
- Thread locks may reduce performance
- **Mitigation**: Use RLock and benchmark performance

### Compatibility
- New dependencies may conflict
- **Mitigation**: Test with multiple Python versions

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Tag current version before changes
2. Keep changes in feature branch until validated
3. Provide compatibility layer for breaking changes
4. Document all changes clearly

## Next Steps
1. Get approval for implementation plan
2. Create feature branch
3. Begin Phase 1 critical fixes
4. Set up daily progress reviews
5. Plan for code review at each phase completion
