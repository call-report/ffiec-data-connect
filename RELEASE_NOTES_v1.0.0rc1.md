# Install with optional dependencies
pip install "ffiec-data-connect[polars,dev]"
```

## üö¶ Usage Example

```python
import asyncio
from ffiec_data_connect import AsyncCompatibleClient, WebserviceCredentials

async def main():
    # Initialize credentials
    creds = WebserviceCredentials(
        username="your_username",
        password="your_password"
    )
    
    # Create async client
    async with AsyncCompatibleClient(creds) as client:
        # Collect data with rate limiting
        data = await client.collect_data_async(
            rssd_id="12345",
            reporting_period="2024-03-31",
            data_series="call"
        )
        print(f"Retrieved {len(data)} records")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## üîÑ Migration from Legacy Versions

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy method signatures supported
- Automatic migration warnings
- Gradual migration path
- Configuration options for legacy behavior

### Recommended Updates
